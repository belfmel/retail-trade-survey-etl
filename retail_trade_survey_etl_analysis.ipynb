    "After creating an automated ETL process on the Monthly Retail Trader Survey data, I am able to analyze the dataset.  There is an uptrend in the retail and food service businesses as well as the beer, wine, and liquor stores.  There is a common decrease in spending across businesses during March-April 2020, which is when covid lockdown happened.  There is also another common decrease in spending in 2008-2009 during the Great Recession.  There is a seasonal trend yearly of an increase in spending during November and December which is during the holiday season. "

    "I will be extracting data from the Monthly Retail Trade Survey since 1992 to the beginning of 2021 and performing an ETL on the data, analyzing the time series, and representing the trends through visual representation.  First, I start by analyzing the Excel sheet that the MRTS data is in and notice the common patterns.  I use the common patterns to build an automated ETL process in Python that loads the data into a table in a MySQL database. I extract every sheet from the excel, transform the dataset by transposing the dataset, and combining all the cleaned datasets into one DataFrame.  This final DataFrame is then loaded into a table in MySQL.  I then begin performing my analysis by finding trends in the different kind of businesses over the years.  This involves querying the dataset to produce a subset of the main data and plotting the data on a graph. After plotting the data, I can notice the trends in the dataset.  I can determine what trends have an uptrend, downtrend, or just stationary.  I look at trends with the raw values, the rolling averages, and the percentage change.  I am able to look at a less volatile dataset with rolling averages versus the raw values.  I am also able to look at the percentage change that shows more unusual changes in the dataset. "

This process involves removing any unnecessary rows or columns, cleaning up column names, changing datatypes if necessary, and deriving new columns from the source columns if necessary.

After I transposed the DataFrame, I changed all values that were (S) or (NA) to zero because I wanted only numeric values for my analysis. I also decided to drop all rows containing a null value since that data won’t be of use during the analysis phase.  The column that contains the date field is an object data type, but I want the column to be of a date datatype.  So I converted the column to a date datatype using the pandas function to_datetime().
